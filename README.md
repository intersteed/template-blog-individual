# template-blog-individual

To use this template, click the button, and make sure you check the button that says "**Include all branches**", so that you get the gh-pages branch. 

You also need to make sure you are making it in the right account. If you want it in your own account or in intersteed, make sure to specify. 

All the code that you will actually use to make the site will be in the gh-pages branch. So, you'll need to look at that when analyzing code. This is just for instructions. 

This is an example for making a path off of https://intersteed.github.io. This site is hosted at https://intersteed.github.io/template-blog-individual/ by default. So, if there is a good reason to make another site, you can easily use this repository. 


The main thing that will need to be changed in using this template to use it is to change the baseurl to the name of your repository. 

`baseurl: '/template-blog-individual'`

It is located in the \_config.yml file. 

After that, it's important to note that you can customize and change everything by following the instructions in the original repository this theme was based off of: https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic. Reading his README.md file (on the main page) will help you know how to use it the best.

The other thing that will help you in editing this is by going through the documentation on this page: especially in adding pages.

Here is the high level: https://pages.github.com/, and then the low level: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll
